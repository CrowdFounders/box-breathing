                Use this animated visual or video to learn the box breathing technique, which is a calming exercise used by Navy SEALs, consisting of equal parts inhaling, holding, exhaling, and holding, typically through the nose to optimize breathing benefits. Distinct from the 4-7-8 method, which emphasizes a longer exhale, box breathing offers a simple, rhythmic pattern to help reduce anxiety and enhance focus. With the aid of an instructional video and a meditation timer, users can practice and maintain a consistent routine, experiencing benefits such as lower blood pressure and a balanced autonomic nervous system. This resource is available as an app, enabling regular practice to improve overall well-being.

                It is worth mentioning another popular breathing technique, called the 4-7-8 method. It involves inhaling through the nose for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling through the mouth for 8 seconds. Both techniques are beneficial, but box breathing is particularly favored for its simplicity and ease of remembering the equal 4-second intervals for each step of the cycle.

                <h2>Box breathing for beginners</h2>
                <p>
                    Box breathing is a simple yet powerful breathing technique that can help reduce anxiety and improve focus. Here's how to practice the technique effectively:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Sit with your back straight in a comfortable position. Relax your shoulders and body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place one hand on your upper chest and the other hand just below your rib cage. This will allow you to monitor your diaphragm's movement as you breathe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Begin by slowly inhaling through your nose for a count of 4 seconds. Ensure that the hand on your stomach feels the rise of your abdomen, indicating diaphragmatic breathing, while the hand on your chest remains mostly still.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the inhalation, hold your breath for 4 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gently exhale through your mouth for 4 seconds. As you exhale, purse your lips slightly, but keep your jaw relaxed. Your abdomen should fall inward, and you should engage your stomach muscles to support the exhalation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conclude the cycle by holding your breath for another 4 seconds before starting your next inhale.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This pattern—inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and hold again for 4 seconds—can be a powerful technique for anxiety management. <b>Beginners might experience feeling out of breath during the exercise; however, with practice, your technique will improve, and being slightly early or late in the cycle is alright as long as you remain comfortable.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that whether you breathe in through your nose or out through your mouth, the essence of the technique is to breathe deeply and rhythmically. By incorporating box breathing into your daily routine, you may enjoy a profound sense of relaxation and mental clarity.
